backend: (need websockets)
python - quart , flask
nodejs - socket.io \*\*\* start here

How to Run (bc I forget):

1. Ngrok
   If you just have ngrok downloaded as an exe:

- navigate to ngrok path (probably in downloads)
- run ngrok.exe
- run command: ngrok http 8000
  If you have ngrok in your path like a normal person:
- run command: ngrok http 8000

2. Server
   node index.js

Kill Ngrok sessions:
taskkill /f /im ngrok.exe

//TODO:
// P1:
// Targeting when have no money
// Skip players with no actions
// items to make sure that someone can win
// owner not being set properly (ToggleScreenButton needs this)

// P2:
// restart game button
// animations
// auto end bid if everyone cancels

// P3:
// redo button box logic (very messy)
// legend for the items (maybe hover text)

turnCounter: 0,
phase: ACTION_SELECTION,
stand: [],
target: '', //person who bid the most or target in Targeting phase
timer: 0,
